# Python Benchmark

This is a simple repo to validate and test any (almost any) python program againts all python 3 versions.

- Python 3.6.15
- Python 3.7.17
- Python 3.8.17
- Python 3.9.17
- Python 3.10.12
- Python 3.11.4
- Python 3.12b4

## Should i care about it

Yes!! ... No ... it depends ...

> “The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.”. Donald Knuth

I love to test and check to see if my programs run faster and / or have a small memory footprint, and that's why i realize: "Why not to write a simple benchmark suite".

Here you find small bits of python code test against major python 3 versions ...

## Dependencies

To run the full tests, please keep in mind the you need **docker** (and docker-compose) installed in the environment.

All the tests run inside a docker container image based on each python version described above.

Since python libs have different behaviors and support versions, inside the **docker/** folder there's a requirements99.txt versioning number.

You also need python installed because of the **src/support/report_aggragete.py** program (it will run at the end of the benchmark.sh bash script).

## How to run

To run the full suite, just type in:

```bash
$> ./benchmarh.sh
```

Results will be write down on the main README.md file (it's partiallys regenerated at each run).

To benchmark a new program, simple put it inside de **src/tests/** folder.

Please also check this metadata tags to put inside the program to be able to change some aspects of execution.

```python
# @DONT_RUN
# @MPROF_INTERVAL: 0.1
# @MPROF_MULTIPROCESS: -M
# @ALLOWED_VERSIONS: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
```

- @DONT_RUN: This file should not be executed (in case of utils routines);
- @MPROF_INTERVAL: To benchmark memory usage mprof is used, this param you maybe able to improve interval collect of memory;
- @MPROF_MULTIPROCESS: In case your program uses python multiprocess (possible params -M or -C, default: -C);
- @ALLOWED_VERSIONS: What python versions your program can be run: from 3.6 to 3.11;

## Results
